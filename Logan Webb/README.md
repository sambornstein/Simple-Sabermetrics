### Repository Files

'Logan_Webb_Analysis.R' is the R script that creates the visualizations and tables that were created in the article. I've also attached Webb's 2019-2021 Statcast data as 'logan_webb_statcast_data.csv'. The Simple Sabermetrics font, Proxima Nova Condensed Black, is attached as 'Proxima Nova Condensed Black.otf'.

### Hex Color Code Reference

As you may notice in the R script found on Github, we used several different hex color codes for Statcast’s pitch colors, as well as the Giants orange team color. The latter can be found online (https://teamcolorcodes.com/mlb-color-codes/) along with the rest of MLB’s team hex color codes. I was unable to find the exact color codes publicly available for Baseball Savant, so I screenshotted their colors and uploaded an image to this website, which returned the hex color codes for me.
