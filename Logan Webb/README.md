'Logan_Webb_Analysis.R' is the R script that creates the visualizations and tables that were created in the article. I've also attached Webb's 2019-2021 Statcast data as 'logan_webb_statcast_data.csv'. The Simple Sabermetrics font, Proxima Nova Condensed Black, is attached as 'Proxima Nova Condensed Black.otf'.
